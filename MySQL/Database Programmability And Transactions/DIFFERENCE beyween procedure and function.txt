differences between functions and procedures:

- A FUNCTION always returns a value using the return statement. PROCEDURE may return one or more values through parameters or may not return any at all.

- Functions are normally used for computations where as procedures are normally used for executing business logic.

- A Function returns 1 value only. Procedure can return multiple values (max 1024).

- Stored procedure always returns an integer value of zero by default. Whereas function return types could be scalar or table or table values.

- Stored procedures have a precompiled execution plan, where as functions are not.

- A function can be called directly by SQL statement like SELECT func_name FROM DUAL while procedures cannot.

- Stored procedure has the security and reduces the network traffic and also we can call stored procedure in any number of applications at a time.

- A Function can be used in the SQL queries while a procedure cannot be used in SQL queries. That causes a major difference between function and procedures.
